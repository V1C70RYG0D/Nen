"""
Production AI Manager Testing Suite for Nen Platform
Comprehensive pytest-compatible testing following GI.md guidelines

Test Requirements:
- Agent Management: load, retrieve, selection, isolation
- Match Management: matchmaking, concurrent matches, state persistence, cleanup
- Performance Integration: 100+ concurrent games, efficiency, memory scaling
- Thread safety and error handling
- Production readiness validation

Implementation follows GI.md:
- 100% test coverage (Guideline #8)
- Real implementation testing (Guideline #2)
- Production-ready quality (Guideline #3)
- No hardcoding or placeholders (Guideline #18)
- Robust error handling (Guideline #20)
- Performance optimization testing (Guideline #21)
- Comprehensive validation (Guideline #15)
