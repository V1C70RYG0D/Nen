// Sample PDF template description

PDF templates are rendered from HTML templates using libraries such as Puppeteer or
jsPDF. Make sure the HTML is well-structured.
This file just documents the process.

Use CSS for page-breaks and styling, and leverage
JavaScript for any dynamic content. Configure PDF generation
environment in your testing setup.
